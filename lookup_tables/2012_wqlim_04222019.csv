The rationale is that our method of analysis by treating each individual DO reading as a data point does not represent well these large datasets with disproportionately spaced samples. That is for this site we have approximately 8 times more data in the winter months (January, October, November and December) than we do in the summer months (August and September). This results in less than 1% exceedance of the criterion in the winter months and a 53% exceedance of the criterion in the summer months.
