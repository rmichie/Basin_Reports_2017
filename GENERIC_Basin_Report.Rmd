# Water Quality Impairments and TMDLs

## Water Quality Impaired Stream Segments

Under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, states, territories and authorized tribes must submit lists of impaired waters. These waters are too polluted or otherwise degraded to meet water quality standards. The law requires that states establish priority rankings for waters on the lists and develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these waters. - Sources: [ODEQ](http://www.oregon.gov/deq/wq/Pages/WQ-Assessment.aspx), [USEPA](https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-303d-listing-impaired-waters)

## TMDL Watershed Plans

The federal Clean Water Act requires that water pollutant reduction plans, called TMDLs, be developed for water bodies that are listed in Category 5 of the Integrated Report (303(d) List). TMDLs describe the maximum amount of pollutants that can enter the river or stream and still meet water quality standards.

TMDLs take into account the pollution from all sources including discharges from industry and sewage treatment facilities, runoff from farms, forests and urban areas, and natural sources. TMDLs include a margin of safety to account for uncertainty, and may include a reserve capacity that allows for future discharges to a river or stream. DEQ typically develops TMDLs on a watershed, subbasin, or basin level and occasionally at the reach level depending on the type and extent of impairments. 

The Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) is the framework for TMDL implementation that is issued by Oregon along with the TMDL (Oregon Administrative Rules 340-042-0040(l)). The TMDL and WQMP serve as a multi-sector plan and provides the blueprint for TMDL related implementation activities. The TMDL and WQMP also provide the reasonable assurance that the plan will be implemented and allocations will be achieved. The following TMDLs have been approved in the `r owrd_basin`:

The Drinking Water Providers Partnership (DWPP) is a collaboration of the Geos Institute, USDA Forest Service Region 6, Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the Washington Department of Health, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management OR/WA Office, and WildEarth Guardians.  Together, the partners coordinates an annual, competitive grant solicitation and award program for environmental conservation and restoration projects in municipal watersheds across the Northwest. The Partners share a common vision that watershed restoration is an important and effective way to provide clean, inexpensive drinking water to communities and protect native fish populations, particularly when downstream and upstream users work together. Goals of the partnership are to:\n\n
* Restore and protect the health of watersheds which communities depend upon for drinking water while also benefiting aquatic and riparian ecosystems, including the native fish that inhabit them.\n
* Support local partnerships between drinking water providers, landowners, and restoration practitioners."}`

The Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB) is a state agency that provides grants to help Oregonians take care of local streams, rivers, wetlands, and natural areas. Community members and landowners use scientific criteria to decide jointly what needs to be done to conserve and improve rivers and natural habitat in the places where they live. OWEB grants are funded from the Oregon Lottery, federal dollars, and salmon license plate revenue. The agency is led by a 17-member citizen board drawn from the public at large, tribes, and federal and state natural resource agency boards and commissions.\n\n

OWEB offers a variety of grant types and programs: http://www.oregon.gov/OWEB/GRANTS/pages/grant_faq.aspx.\n\n

The OWEB mission of helping to protect and restore healthy watersheds and natural habitats that support thriving communities and strong economies implicitly recognizes that specific goals for improvement will vary between watersheds. OWEB grants fund a variety of activities that local partners have identified as priorities in watershed assessments, action plans, or regional plans such as ESA Recovery Plans, Groundwater Management Areas, or TMDLs. Restoration actions address watershed process and functions necessary to support natural processes that are indicative of healthy watersheds. This includes, but is not limited to improving water quality, water quantity, habitat complexity, flood plain interaction, vegetation structure, and species diversity."}`

# Water Quality Status and Trends

Data for the stations in the Basin were retreived from DEQ (LASAR and ELEMENT), EPA (Storet) USGS (NWIS, Water Quality Portal) databases. The time period for the data query was from 2000-01-01 to 2018-03-01. Parameters included in the query were temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, and bacteria. Data collected on tribal nation land was not included. Only availiable data with a DEQ data quality status of A+, A, and B was retained for the analysis. Quality status is determined following the DEQ's Laboratory Quality Manual. All EPA and USGS data  were included unless result comments indicated problems with the data. Recent data (after June 2014) from the USGS was marked as provisional data and included in this analysis. 

Status was assessed by evaluating water quality results in relation to the applicable water quality criterion or TMDL allocations. Some stations that had suffceint data to be evaluatied for status have a result of NA. This is because the applicable water quality critiera is not yet assigned to those stations. Assignment of the applicable water quality crieria must be compleated by hand. Because this analysis was conducted across the entire state there was not enougth time to complete the manual assignments.  DEQ water quality standards program is currently working on this task and will have mapping for all stations in the state complete in 2018.

Trends were calculated using a Seasonal Kendall test (Hirsch et al 1982, Hirsch and Slack 1984, and Helsel and Hirsch 2002) at sites with a minimum of eight or more years of available data. A seasonal Kendall test removes the influence of season-to-season fluctuations by calculating the Mann Kendall test (Mann 1945) on each season separately and then comparing the slopes. A significant positive or negative trend was determined across all seasons and years when the significance of the seasonal slopes had a two-tailed p < 0.10.  Prior to applying the seasonal Kendall test data were grouped into monthly "seasons". If the variation in sampling frequency was random, multiple observations within any given month will were collapsed into a single value using the median, otherwise the mean was used.

A summary of water quality status and trends for stations in each subbasin follow in the tables below.
