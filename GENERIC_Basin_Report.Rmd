# Water Quality Impairments and TMDLs

## Water Quality Impaired Stream Segments

Under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, states, territories and authorized tribes must submit lists of impaired waters. These waters are too polluted or otherwise degraded to meet water quality standards. The law requires that states establish priority rankings for waters on the lists and develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these waters. - Sources: [ODEQ](http://www.oregon.gov/deq/wq/Pages/WQ-Assessment.aspx), [USEPA](https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-303d-listing-impaired-waters)

## Total Maximum Daily Load Watershed Plans

The federal Clean Water Act requires that water pollutant reduction plans, called Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), be developed for water bodies that are listed in Category 5 of the Integrated Report (303(d) List). TMDLs describe the maximum amount of pollutants that can enter the river or stream and still meet water quality standards.

TMDLs take into account the pollution from all sources including discharges from industry and sewage treatment facilities, runoff from farms, forests and urban areas, and natural sources. TMDLs include a margin of safety to account for uncertainty, and may include a reserve capacity that allows for future discharges to a river or stream. DEQ typically develops TMDLs on a watershed, subbasin, or basin level and occasionally at the reach level depending on the type and extent of impairments. 

The Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) is the framework for TMDL implementation that is issued by Oregon along with the TMDL (Oregon Administrative Rules 340-042-0040(l)). The TMDL and WQMP serve as a multi-sector plan and provides the blueprint for TMDL related implementation activities. The TMDL and WQMP also provide the reasonable assurance that the plan will be implemented and allocations will be achieved. The following TMDLs have been approved in the `r owrd_basin`:

Federal Section 319(h) funds are provided annually through the EPA to states for the development and implementation of each state's Nonpoint Source Management Program. In Oregon a portion of 319 grant funding is used to support community or partner projects that address Oregon's nonpoint source program priorities.

The Clean Water State Revolving Fund loan program provides below market rate loans to public agencies for the planning, design and construction of various projects that prevent or mitigate water pollution. Eligible agencies include federally recognized Indian tribal governments, cities, counties, sanitary districts, soil and water conservation districts, irrigation districts, various special districts and intergovernmental entities. DEQ partners with Oregon communities to implement projects that attain and maintain water quality standards, and are necessary to protect beneficial uses.

The Oregon Health Authority regulates drinking water under state law and the Safe Drinking Water Act and works cooperatively with DEQ on source water protection efforts. Using the Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund, OHA funds Source Water Protection Grants (up to $30,000 per public water system) for source water protection activities, monitoring, and planning in Drinking Water Source Areas. In addition, loans are available for improving drinking water treatment, source water protection activities, or land acquisition in source areas. Oregon's Infrastructure Finance Authority is responsible for administering these projects. The loan fund set-asides also fund five Drinking Water Protection positions at DEQ that provide technical assistance to public water systems and communities while they develop and implement strategies that reduce the risk within the delineated source water areas.

Oregon DEQ participates in the Drinking Water Providers Partnership (DWPP) with USDA Forest Service Region 6, EPA Region 10, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management OR/WA Office, the Washington Department of Health, Geos Institute and WildEarth Guardians. Together, these partners coordinate a competitive grant solicitation and award program for environmental conservation and restoration projects in municipal watersheds across the Northwest. The Drinking Water Providers Partnership made the first of the annual awards in 2016 and most projects have a focus on nonpoint sources of pollution. The goal of the Partnership and the funding is to develop and support local partnerships to restore and protect the health of watersheds which communities depend upon for drinking water while also benefiting aquatic and riparian ecosystems, including the native fish that inhabit them.

The Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB) is a state agency that provides grants to help Oregonians take care of local streams, rivers, wetlands, and natural areas. These grant projects often address nonpoint sources of pollution and are thus included in this report.

# Water Quality Status and Trends

Data for the stations in the Basin were retrieved from DEQ (LASAR and ELEMENT), EPA (Storet) USGS (NWIS, Water Quality Portal) databases. The time period for the data query was from 2000-01-01 to 2018-03-01. Parameters included in the query were temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, and bacteria. Data collected on tribal nation land was not included. Only available data with a DEQ data quality status of A+, A, and B were retained for the analysis. Quality status is determined following the DEQ's Laboratory Quality Manual. All EPA and USGS data  were included unless result comments indicated problems with the data. Recent data (after June 2014) from the USGS was marked as provisional data and included in this analysis. 

Status was assessed by evaluating water quality results in relation to the applicable water quality criterion or TMDL allocations. Some stations that had sufficient data to be evaluated for status have a result of NA. This is because the applicable water quality criteria are not yet assigned to those stations. Assignment of the applicable water quality crieria must be completed by hand. Because this analysis was conducted across the entire state there was not enough time to complete the manual assignments.  DEQ water quality standards program is currently working on this task and will have mapping for all stations in the state complete in 2018.

Trends were calculated using a Seasonal Kendall test (Hirsch et al 1982, Hirsch and Slack 1984, and Helsel and Hirsch 2002) at sites with a minimum of eight or more years of available data. A seasonal Kendall test removes the influence of season-to-season fluctuations by calculating the Mann Kendall test (Mann 1945) on each season separately and then comparing the slopes. A significant positive or negative trend was determined across all seasons and years when the significance of the seasonal slopes had a two-tailed p < 0.10.  Prior to applying the seasonal Kendall test data were grouped into monthly "seasons". If the variation in sampling frequency was random, multiple observations within any given month will were collapsed into a single value using the median, otherwise the mean was used.

A summary of water quality status and trends for stations in each subbasin follow in the tables below.


```{r status-trend-tbls, results="asis"}

# get the water quality status and trend summary data frames as a list where each list is for a sepetate subbasin
wqst.list <- get.wqst.summary(huc8.list=huc8.df$HUC_8, df.dir=wqst.dir)

for (i in seq_along(huc8.df$HUC_8)){
  cat('\n\n')
  huc8 <- as.character(huc8.df$HUC_8[i])
